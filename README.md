# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Xiaohan.

- I love reading and learning about new ideas and information ranging from classical literature to specialised non-fiction because no knowledge is bad knowledge.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I am learning a variety of computer science concepts and areas in order to gain broader knowledge regarding the industry. For example, computer networking concepts, cybersecurity and algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Currently teaching myself the MERN stack having completed projects using Vanilla Javascript. I also have knowledge and experience using SQL and Java.
- ðŸ“« My email address is xiaohanma99@hotmail.com
